Simulation studies were carried out to evaluate and compare different statistical methodsâ€™ Type I error rates and powers based on a large number of simulated datasets. 
We performed simulation studies based on multiple types of datasets containing covariates generated from a standard normal distribution and responses generated by 4 different distributions that are prone to produce outliers to compare two test statistics generated by regression methods with quadratic loss and absolute loss. Datasets contain 10 covariates that have been equally divided into 2 groups with each containing 5. Each group of covariates is controlled by a vector of 5 beta values. The mean of response is
$$
Y_i = \alpha + S_{i1}^T\beta_1 + S_{i2}^T\beta_2 + \gamma (S_{i1}^T\beta_1) (S_{i2}^T\beta_2)
$$
where $\beta_2=0.2, \alpha=3, \gamma=1$ and $ S_{1} and S_{2}$ are two groups of covariates. The detail of response generation is listed in table 1.
To evaluate type 1 error, we set all 5 values in the vector of $\beta_1$ to be 0. We use B = 200 bootstrap samples for each simulated dataset. We first compute the observed test statistic, and then compute B bootstrapped test statistics under null. We compute the p-value as the proportion of the bootstrapped test statistics larger than the observed test statistic. Specifically, $p-value = \sum I(T_b > T_{obs})/B$. The process was repeated 1000 times with one specific group of parameters and for each time, the p-value was recorded in another vector. There are in total 4 groups of parameters with each one containing a different sample size of 50, 100, 200 and 500. Finally among these 1000 values, the percentage that the value is smaller than or equal to 0.05 was calculated and recorded.
To evaluate the power, we set values of gradient from 0.1 to 0.8 for all 5 values in the vector of $\beta_1$. We used the same method of bootstrap samples for each simulated dataset. The process was repeated 300 times with one specific group of parameters and for each time, the p-value was recorded in another vector. Apart from different values for $beta_1$ 4 different sample sizes of 50, 100, 200 and 500 were also applied in each different group of parameters. Finally, among these 300 values, the percentage of values smaller than or equal to 0.05 was calculated and recorded.
